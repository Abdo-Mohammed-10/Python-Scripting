# Python-Scripting
### A Python script, the file containing the commands, is structured to be executed like a program. These files are designed to contain various functions and import various modules. Python interactive shell or the respective command line is used to execute the script, to perform a specific task. A script is structured by defining the set of function definitions and then stating the main program used to call the functions.

### A program consists of numerous tasks; these tasks can be executed with the help of scripts. Unlike libraries, scripts can be used without importing and are less code-intensive.
